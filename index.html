        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a passionate game developer currently studying at the SAE Institute. I specialize in Unity and Unreal Engine, focusing on gameplay mechanics, game optimization, and AI development.
        <br>During my time at SAE, Iâ€™ve worked on several solo projects, ranging from 2D platformers to 3D adventure games. My goal is to continue honing my skills and contribute to innovative game projects in the industry.</p>
        
        <p>Before transitioning into game development, I worked as an Electronics engineer, where I developed a deep understanding of hardware systems, circuit design, and troubleshooting electronic components. This experience gives me a unique perspective on the interplay between software and hardware, and has been invaluable in optimizing game performance and working with complex systems.</p>
    
        <p>Programming Languages I use:</p>
        <ul class="tech-list"></ul>
            <li>Assembler</li>
            <li>C</li>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>C#</li>
            <li>Lua</li>
            <li>HTLM, CSS & Javascripts</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Some of my prototypes and project are not uploaded yet on my github, but will be soon.</p>
