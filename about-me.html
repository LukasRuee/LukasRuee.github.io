                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Lukas Rüegsegger, and I am a passionate game developer with a background in electronics engineering.
                    Currently, I’m studying at the SAE Institute, specializing in game development with a focus on building immersive,
                    engaging experiences using industry-standard tools like Unity and Unreal Engine.</p>
            
                <p>During my time at SAE, I have worked on a variety of projects, both solo and collaborative,
                    that span multiple genres including 2D platformers, 3D adventure games, and even interactive simulations.
                    My main areas of expertise are gameplay mechanics, tool development, and code optimization.
                    I enjoy the challenge of creating smooth and responsive gameplay, as well as the technical puzzle of
                    optimizing performance for both PC and console platforms. I really enjoy createing clean and high quality projects</p>
            
                <p>One of the aspects I love most about game development is the opportunity to blend creativity with technical problem-solving.
                    I thrive on turning innovative ideas into reality by coding complex game mechanics, developing dynamic and
                    intelligent AI behaviors and refining the player experience. I’m constantly learning new techniques and technologies
                    to improve the quality and performance of my games.</p>

                <h3>Previous Experience: From Electronics Engineer to Game Developer</h3>
                <p>Before pursuing game development and coding in general, I worked as an Electronics Engineer. This experience has given me a solid
                    understanding of hardware systems, circuit design, and troubleshooting electronic components. I’ve worked extensively with
                    embedded systems and microcontrollers, which has not only enhanced my problem-solving skills but also provided me with a
                    deep understanding of how software interfaces with hardware. I started by programming in Assembler, then C all the way up to C# and more
                    high-level languages.</p>
            
                <p>My engineering background has given me a unique perspective on software development, especially when it comes to
                    optimizing performance and troubleshooting technical issues. I approach coding with an engineer’s precision,
                    ensuring that my code is efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain. This mindset has proven invaluable when working with
                    resource-constrained environments, whether it's optimizing a game for different platforms or squeezing every bit of
                    performance out of a system.</p>

                <h3>Skills and Technologies</h3>
                <p>Here are some of the programming languages, tools, and frameworks I use:</p>

                <h4>Languages</h4>
                <ul class="tech-list">
                    <li>Assembler</li>
                    <li>C</li>
                    <li>C++</li>
                    <li>C# (primarily for Unity)</li>
                    <li>Lua</li>
                    <li>HTML, CSS & JavaScript (for web-based games and interactive experiences)</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Tools</h4>
                <ul class="tech-list">
                    <li>Unity</li>
                    <li>Unreal Engine 5</li>
                    <li>Visual Studio</li>
                    <li>STM32</li>
                    <li>Arduino</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>In addition to my programming skills, I’m proficient in using tools like Git for version control.
                    I’ve also worked with Blender and Aseprite for asset creation and animation integration into my games,¨
                    allowing me to handle both the technical and artistic sides of game development.</p>

                <h3>My Journey as a Game Developer</h3>
                <p>My journey in game development started as a hobby while I was still working as an electronics engineer.
                    I started experimenting with simple 2D game engines and quickly fell in love with the creative process.
                    From there, I transitioned into learning more complex game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine.
                    Over the years, I’ve been refining my skills by working on a wide range of projects — 
                    everything from Tetris on a ST microcontroller with an simple monochrom-display up to entries to larger, 
                    more complex game prototypes and game jams.</p>
            
                <p>One of my proudest achievements is a 3D adventure game prototype I developed, where I focused on creating realistic AI 
                    behaviors and a highly interactive game environment. This project not only sharpened my programming skills 
                    but also taught me a lot about complex systems, unmanaged code structures, and more. As I continue my 
                    education at SAE Institute, I’m eager to take on more ambitious projects and push the boundaries of what 
                    I can create.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-box">
                <h3>Future Goals</h3>
                <p>Looking ahead, my goal is to contribute to innovative game projects in the industry, 
                    either by joining a game studio or continuing to develop indie projects. 
                    I’m particularly interested in exploring the realms of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), 
                    as I believe these platforms represent the future of immersive gaming experiences. 
                    I’m also passionate about multiplayer game development, and I plan to further enhance my skills in network 
                    programming and server-client architectures.</p>
            
                <p>In the short term, I’m focused on completing my studies at SAE Institute and expanding my portfolio 
                    with more complex projects. Some of my prototypes will soon be available on my GitHub, sharing my work
                    as a basis for others. I’m excited to share these projects with the world and showcase the depth and breadth 
                    of my game development skills.</p>
